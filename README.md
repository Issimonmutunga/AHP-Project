# AHP Tool for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)

## 📚 Project Overview
This project showcases the use of the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) tool within ArcGIS Desktop. It focuses on location suitability analysis by integrating spatial data, expert judgment, and weighted criteria. The project was carried out as part of my academic work in Geospatial Engineering.
